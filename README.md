Every replicates(individual or together) in the 3 datasets H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 and dataset H3K27ac have a fixed number of cell-types in it. H3K4me3 has two replicates: 1 and 2 . H3K27 holds  replicate 1 and replicates 1 and 2 together. Dataset H3K36 has only replicate 1. For combined analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 we have a folder named H3K4me3-H3K27me3(combined). In each dataset folder there are 4 subfolders named IQA, MLQA ,ML and Overlap representation. Here in the three folders named ML, MLQA and IQA we have included the results from these three cell-type tree generation methods. All the three folders contain cell-type tree in newick format.  Estimated quartet files which we generated for MLQA and IQA methods, are given in both MLQA and IQA folders. Finally the overlap representation data for the cell-types are in the folder Overlap representation. In this folder we have a text file named Overlap_datarepresentaion in which the the two numbers in the first row contains the number of cell-types and data length. After that each row identified by t1,t2 etc carries the overlap data. The mapping from t1, t2 etc to original cell-types are provided in file_sequence text file.
